run dag 

2. SNR_DSG_EXTRACT :

After above run is over , run this to check if corner cases are there 
s3://gilead-us-west-2-us-comm-compute-prd/us/input/SNR_DSG_Extract/
and if yes then send to ds&g team for it.

3. Config_ingestion 361 sao excel
s3://gilead-us-west-2-us-comm-compute-prd/us/input/sao/STG_SAO_SLS_EXCL/

4. then trigger MASTER_TUESDAY_HIV_HBV_HCV
check if source files are arrived :
s3://gilead-us-west-2-us-comm-compute-prd/CAH/COBI/ - for xpo hiv hbv 
s3://gilead-us-west-2-us-comm-compute-prd/CAH/IMS/HCV/outbox/ - for xpo HCV 
s3://gilead-us-west-2-us-comm-compute-prd/CAH/ZS/from_gold/ - for AHM_ingestion 


 which used to run 


** IQVIA_XPO_Ingestion_HBV
These are triggered when files are avaiable in S3
to check file path in dataset master --- select * from ctl_dataset_master where dataset_id=701;( check for ids 705,702,703,704)-- has file and path details 
source file loc : s3://gilead-us-west-2-us-comm-compute-prd/CAH/COBI/

** IQVIA_XPO_Ingestion_HCV
These are triggered when files are avaiable in S3
to check file path in dataset master --- select * from ctl_dataset_master where dataset_id=707;( check for ids 706,708,709,710)
spuce file path : s3://gilead-us-west-2-us-comm-compute-prd/CAH/IMS/HCV/outbox

after these complete trigger 
** STG_IQVIA_SALES_HBV_HIST
** STG_IQVIA_SALES_HCV_HIST

then work tables are run with parallel to hiv all run at a time 

Select * from log_file_dtl where dataset_ids=701;  --- file load detail
select * from log_file_smry where dataset_id=701;  --- just file loaded is shown
select * from log_batch_dtl where dataset_id=701;  --- batch id date can be checked
