VA INGESTION 
VA File is received in EXCEL format. We need to open the excel, save it as a CSV ( comma delimited) and also rename it correctly as per ctl_dataset_master. 
Once the Excel workbook is saved as CSV, we need to open the CSV in notepad to ensure that there is no null data in the VA File and then upload the CSV to its file source location
